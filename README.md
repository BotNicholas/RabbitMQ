# What is it all about?

Here I've added RabbitMQ producers and Consumers for Solid Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Stream

## RabbitMQ Flow

In RabbitMQ, producers send messages to an exchange, the exchange uses bindings and a routing key to find the appropriate queue, places the message in the queue, and the consumer reads from the queue.
